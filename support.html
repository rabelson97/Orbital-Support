    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <p><strong>Q: How do focus sessions work?</strong><br>
        A: Set your desired focus time and Orbital breaks it into 5-minute planet generation intervals. Each interval
        creates a unique planet while you focus on your work.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Can I pause a session?</strong><br>
        A: Yes, sessions automatically pause when you leave the app and resume when you return.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Where are my completed planets stored?</strong><br>
        A: All your generated planets are saved locally on your device and can be viewed in your planet collection.</p>
